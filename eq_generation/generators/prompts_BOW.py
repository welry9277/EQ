3. Convert long background descriptions containing verbs into concise modifiers.

4. Maintain the texture and action of the sound by combining the sound's subject with a present participle (-ing) instead of a regular verb.

2. Soften stiff noun phrases (e.g., 'repeated barking') into verb-modifying structures (e.g., 'barking repeatedly').

2. Consolidate phrases that have different wording but the same meaning into a single, clean expression.

4. Do not stiffly glue the collected sound information (main sound, background, texture) together. Weave them into a fluent, single-breath sentence using connectors like 'accompanied by', 'while', 'during', or ', producing'."""
